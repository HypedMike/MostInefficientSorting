# Most inefficient sorting algorithm

## Description
This is a simple sorting algorithm that is very inefficient. It is not recommended to use this algorithm for any purpose other than educational.
It works by launching a thread for each element of the array. Each thread waits for a duration equal to the value of the array element at its respective position, then it prints the result.

## Usage
to test the algorithm, run the following command:
```bash
$ sh ./run.sh
```
